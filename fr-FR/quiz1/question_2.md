## legend: Question 2 of 3

Here is some JavaScript you used in your project.

```
function checkAnswer(question, result) {

}
```

Here is some HTML you used with the JavaScript.

```
<button id="q1" onclick="checkAnswer('q1', '#result1')">Check Answer</button>
```

Which of these is an argument passed to the parameter `question`?

\--- choices ---

- ( ) `id="q1"`

  \--- feedback ---

  Not quite! The `id` attribute of the button element is used to change it later.

  \--- /feedback ---

- (x) `'q1'`

  \--- feedback ---

  Correct! When the function runs, it uses the parameter `question` to refer to the first value passed to it as an argument (in this case `q1`). The second argument is `'#result1'`, which is passed to the parameter `result`.

  \--- /feedback ---

- ( ) `checkAnswer`

  \--- feedback ---

  Not quite! `checkAnswer` is the name of the function that handles the button's `onclick` event.
