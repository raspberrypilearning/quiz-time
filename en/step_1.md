## Introduction

In this project you will create a web app that lets the user show what they know about a topic of your choosing! You could make a quiz about history, nature, world records, science, sports, fashion, TV, movies... or anything else you're an expert in! 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
The internet has helped us <span style="color: #0faeb0">**share knowledge**</span> and ideas to people around the globe. Sharing knowledge helps us understand other communities and cultures and reminds us we can all learn from each other.
</p>

You will:
+ Choose a topic and create questions
+ Use buttons, CSS and JavaScript to animate, show and hide questions
+ Use JavaScript to check the user's answers, keep track of their score and display a final message
