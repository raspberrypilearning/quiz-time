When you created the next question function, you had to check if the index of the **current** question (`currentQ`) was one fewer than the number of questions in the `questions` list.

Which one of these was used to create the list?

- (x) `querySelectorAll()`

  \--- feedback ---

  Правильно!

  `querySelectorAll()` returns a list of the document's elements that match a specified group of selectors. The example used `document.querySelectorAll(".q-container")` to return a list of all elements that had the class `q-container`.
