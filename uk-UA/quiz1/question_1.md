Which of these attributes allows the user to click on a label to select a radio option?

\--- choices ---

- (x) `for`

  \--- feedback ---

  Правильно! The `for` attribute links the label to an `<input>` element's `id` attribute.

- ( ) `name`

  \--- feedback ---

  Не зовсім так! Using `name` allows only one radio button in the name group to be selected at a time.

  `label` is a type of element, not an element attribute.
